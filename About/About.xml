If the original author requests it, I will remove this update.

Added "A Dog Said" patch, and both Hyenas now use the same meat. 

[1.3 only] If you run Vanilla Animals Expanded - Desert, its Hyena is patched to use the same meat as the two from this mod.

[1.4/1.5] If you run Vanilla Animals Expanded and/or HC Animals Continued, their hyenas are removed.

If you run [XND] Nocturnal Animals (Continued), Hyenas are nocturnal.
